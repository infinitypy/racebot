imagine how easy it would be to btfo everyone calling you out with a video showing that you beat people legit, such an easy way to be like "hey, you sniped me, even when I just had a superior legit strat?, damn bro...", and yet somehow absolutely no one fucking does this

psa tip for anyone in the community who is a top 50 grinder and got or almost got top 3, just record your shit, it's that easy. instant community respect and transparency, at 0 expense of your own

- Mid path Dartling A-
 - Gorgon Storm is such a cool MK man. Like it stuns so much and it has so much range and its uptime is actually pretty high. Like 30% or something like that. It can also stun DDTs so that means that stuff like Sabotage Supply Lines actually is kinda outclassed by Rocket Storm ability. Every single Odyssey these days (which I play on Hard mode now, I previously couldn't beat Hard mode without using all my Monkey Money on powers and instas) I just build my early game defense, which is always my favorite 4-2-0 Sniper since it pops leads and camo bloons (which means I'm set against the super difficult round 59 where some of the bloons are both camos and leads), and then start building tons of 2-4-0 Dartling Gunners. Honestly I'm super happy that Ninja Kiwi added this Monkey Knowledge, even though I had to buy a couple packs of Monkey Knowledge and Monkey Money to reach Gorgon Storm. I hope they add something even cooler like COBRA from my second favorite game Bloons Tower Defense Battles, or even like C4 Charlie from my third favorite game Bloons Adventure Time Tower Defense.

You are the type of player that spends 26 hours a day playing a dumb video game. Go touch grass. Seriously stop bragging about this dumb video game. I have looked at your profile and you always brag about having 1000000000 hours. Shut up let people enjoy the game and have fun. I don't wann hear your dumb tips on how to play the game I wanna use my own startegies. You can't control me. You can't force me to use your bs. And now you are just being an elitist again. 5 seconds ago u said "Oh guys I have 1000000000000 hours and all BBs xd you guys are noobs" that's toxic elitism. You are basically saying that those who don't have all BBs are trash at the game and that's not pog. And now u said "the sad part is that none of what I said even denotes that much skill" that is just on a whole different level. It is sad that people like you still exist in the video gaming community. If everyone stopped bragging about how good they are the world would be a much better place.

i just need to fucking say it. If i put over 1000 hours into something and then replicate every almost every hard thing ever done with it and then go on to do shit thats much much harder it is not egotistical to view myself as the best at it. nor is it egotistical for me to say that there is a chance that something that took me 15 hours using something that i have over 1000 hours of practice in may be the hardest thing ever done in the game. note i have almost never called plorder the hardest thing in the game i usually say "arguably" or "probably" and whenever i have been in an actual civil discussion most of the time people agree that plorder is in fact probably the hardest thing ever done in the game. not to mention that there is no reason for you to argue when i call something harder than something else when the person that did that something else agrees with me.
~race,races,racer,racers,colt,slowdown
**Regarding the slowdown drama:**

If you don’t know what happened, on race 146 (Bloons to the corn) I had uploaded a race guide to my YouTube channel , after other peoples suspects and me admitting, I had used slowdown to get a decent time at that point (1:10.41) so I could upload a video to the race. with all honesty, I have no idea why I did it, could be because I needed it to compete with other racers, since at this point many already use slowdown to get a top 3 score, on the other hand, I didn't even need it, 2 hours later I streamed in this server and got a 1:10.01 while people were watching, which showed I did not need it, 1 day later, I got a 1:09.26 without slowdown. After all it was a very dumb decision to use slowdown and break everyone's trust in a server moderator just  to get a video out, it will (definitely) never happen again, and I am very sorry for what I did, I don't expect you to forgive me, but I just want you to know that I am aware of what I did, and that it was wrong, Colt.

**Chocbox**

Chocbox is a patented plastic box for safely enclosing electrical connections made with screw connector strips. It was invented by entrepreneur Peter Moule, who appeared on the BBC television programme *Dragons' Den* in 2007. He secured a deal with two "dragons", Duncan Bannatyne and James Caan, for £150,000 funding and soon made a deal for sales worth £25 million. Bannatyne describes Chocbox as one of his best investments from the show.

Hello, as you may be aware, someone was discussion roomed for completing all the expert maps Black Border. By itself, we are perfectly fine with people showing their achievements, however on closer inspection it was revealed in another server that the person who posted this openly talked about using alt BTD6 accounts with infinite MM hacks to practice races as well as talked about unflagging accounts after using mods. As such, I have solely decided to ban this person who is causing a commotion in this server. It is simply hypocritical from some of the community to allow people to use hacked accounts to gain advantage in competitive areas just to flaunt while completely trying to destroy people who are using for example, pirated versions that are basically identical copies of the legitimate version for simply being in a a situation where they cannot financially pay for BTD6. Fyi, Raven was debating whether to let the person go until staff were available since they were being relatively co-operative, it is me who insisted on him staying in the room and me who is banning the person. Another part of the reason why I am banning is that the person is acting as if they are completely innocent while deliberately trying to demonise the moderators in this server for doing the unacceptable things I mentioned above. That is all. Anyone who talks about how anyone involved in moderation is being unfair about this in chat I will personally ban for one week for trying to cause a ruckus in the server.
~bank,monkeybank,battles,btdb,btdbattles,egulio
The monkey bank in general sucks as if you want to go for a passive style it is simply more effective to rush straight for a bia. As while it is mathematically better to get a bank with 1 plantation on the side and then get a r17 bia without banking out it directly gives the advantage to the enemy for multiple reasons. First You will have only a small amount of budget to afford defense and still be able to pull it off and at the same time you absolutely cannot rush the enemy allowing them to even sell defenses and get better farms then you while still being able to rush. Exemples would be equalizing with a r16 bia while forcing defense r16 which is an important round for ai layering. Or selling defense to get a r15 bia and overshadow your r14 bank.

Outside of this specific scenario which has a use in 1 single scenario (DFA vs NFE) bank sucks, getting a bank without the gimmik of upgrading to a bia without banking out is straight up just losing 1k$ even if you gain 30 eco it's not worth as getting a bia would give 80 eco in 1 round and once again overshadow your effort. You can argue that bank is useful in moab drain games where both players are stuck with low eco and low farms r20+ but those situations don't happen in competitive anymore.
~bad,badmod,mod,arbel,arbeldamonkey,sec,seclate
I suppose I will have to tell to the server owners about your absurd behavior and abuse of your powers and abilities, furthermore, I don't think you are a good mod if you treat people of the server harshly and taking roles of players of the server, I don't think you deserve to be a moderator after this action, this wasn't intended to be a good deed and I don't understand why you would do that.

If I may disturb you good sir I couldn't help but notice you are having trouble finding the time the race rewards are distributed. While this prestigious discord does have access to this information, unfortunately as you did not defeat <@!217726724752932864> in battle we cannot freely impart this knowledge to you. As a result you have been confined to this humble, yet cozy corner of the server to spend the rest of your days.
If you have any qualms with the result of this decision you may take it up with our wonderful staff at support@ninjakiwi.com.
We have an incredible track record of always solving each and every issue that is brought to us and we hope to hear from you shortly.

Through the tedious and accurate mathematical testing of our support staff we have come to the conclusion that buying each and every one of those road spikes cost too much for any one person to have attained legitimately. Since this is the case we won't be answering any more queries. Have a nice day.

You are not proffesional, because proffesionals knew how to lose and corngratulate opponents, you are like a girl crying after i beat you! Be brave, be honest to yourself and stop this trush talkings!!! Everybody know that i am very good racer, i can outmicro anyone in the world in single free attempt! And "c"hoc "b"ox is nobody for me, just a player who are crying every single time when loosing, ( remember what you say about FenixKillah ) !!! Stop playing with my name, i deserve to have a good name during whole my race carrier, I am Officially inviting you to mini race match with the Prize fund! Both of us will invest 5000MM and winner takes it all!

I suggest all other people who's intrested in this situation, just take a look at my results in BADv2 and Corngratulations, and that should be enough... No need to listen for every crying babe, RandyZ524 is always play Fair ! And if someone will continue Officially talk about me like that, we will meet in Court! God bless with true!

Gaming is not about "fun". As a gamer I’ll have you know that a game is 100x more “fun” if you actually KNOW HOW TO PLAY IT.

If the person I’m talking to wants to stay trash forever, however they can ignore my advice. It’s fine with me.

You are going to ban me because my opinions were to controversial. But you wouldn't ban the index guys for having controversial opinions despite the fact they legit raided this server with there awful Plasma Monkey Fan club and Pop and Awe accounts. They are fine. You wouldn't ban Randy or Exephur for there controversial tier list would you? No because if you did there would be a massive uproar from the community. But little me, you can ban me right? Only the big people in the community are allowed opinions. Let's not mention the Galgate hate I have received for an opinion while none of them got any punishment at all as far as I know (correct me if I am wrong) punish those who were hateful to me and I will understand but don't punish me in a clearly biased attempt to target me specifically for something I have down they everyone else does but gets no punishment because they are well known. Double standards. Sorry if his sounds rude but I must get my point across.
~apache,apachedartship,dartship,heli,helipilot,dps,apacheprime,prime
NO. Apache Dartship is not terrible. The Apache Dartship is the top path tier 4 $21k upgrade for the Heli Pilot from BTD6. While it may seem expensive, it really isn’t. It’s main purpose isn’t to be actual DPS, it’s to save for Apache Prime. The Apache Prime, though, is insane, making CHIMPS easy even on some harder maps. Even though the Apache Dartship’s tier 3 and below upgrades are pretty underwhelming, they’re cheap, have lead popping power, and can have camo. So that’s a cheap camo lead tier 3 tower that you can control. Also, the Apache Dartship has a good tier 5, but the tier 4 is also really good. It can defend the somewhat challenging midgame rounds, easily destroying 63 without having to get any extra support, and it has good MOAB damage. So, it’ll destroy both the children and the mother, which is a great thing. The 80’s and above are terrible for it, though. But you’ll most likely have the Apache Prime.

TL;DR: The Apache Dartship is a perfect tower and nothing can beat it.
~ezili,qwerty,qwertyxp2000,placement,chimps
Placement such that she can reach the lower-left curve's "bottom", the lower-left curve's "top" and the mere edge of the middle section of the lane makes her able to beat Round 6. Set on Last to leave just one Red after the Greens. Quickly shift to First once the Red approaches within range and attack is on cooldown. Did not yet test for later rounds, but she can solo Round 6 on said map. (Qwertyxp2000, ZMVTRXH; accidentally forgot CHIMPS stats, but fortunately only forgot the C-M-P-S missing elements, so she starts at Level 1 regardless because MK is disabled, and selling would be useless, lol, and continues and powers are not usable on CE anyway)
~bma,bloonmasteralch,bloonmasteralchemist,oneshot,one-shot,zomg,zomgs
Um actually, bma is amazing. Even ignoring his cash generation for a second because of game modes like deflation and chimps, he's still insanely powerful, effective, and efficient. His ability to one-shot multiple zomgs (i repeat, zomgs!!!) at a time is such an invaluable asset to any strat he's in, including once you get into r81+ where the blimps have more health and drop stronger ceramics. He can effectively solo late game rounds like 94, 96, and even the dreaded 98 you constantly die to. And in terms of how cost effective he is, you're essentially buying infinite dps for roughly 40k, meaning his cost efficiency is just as infinite! Then when we actually bring income into the equation, he gets even better as he actually makes you money (not loses it like everyone likes to claim). With him being the last purchase you make with an insane return on value, his money loss doesn't matter. You. Are. Wrong. End of.

It’s honestly impressive how lazy some people are, they just don’t care enough to test out what their argument is. So next time you want to mindlessly hate on Ring of Fire like the rest of the herd, maybe stop and legitimately test it out before coming up with your incomplete conclusion. And clearly Ring of Fire’s movement has some backup, with top tier Bloons players like ISAB even advocating for and using it in his latest video.

the system in place clearly isnt working even your stobbourn ass should be able to admit that having submissions from september 2nd and having missed info from august 17th is a problem

Look man you cant say that there would be only 2 people with moderation power and that would be an issue when currently only 1 person does jack shit. Moch, nate, and tremen all do nothing for this server. Some of my favorite people in the community but they do not moderate this server at all

The people you are declining are the people that want to help you

"All of you suck" all you are doing is describing yourself

your complete inability to do what little it takes to help this community that you helped create

I get that you might not care about index anymore but that doesnt mean that we dont either. You really expect to get college kids sending you their resume to apply for moderator on a fucking btd6 server? Completely unrealistic.
What you will get is a bunch of 13-17 Year olds with a passion for this game willing to spend some time to help out the community.

~exe,exephur,exephur2000,colton,coltont,greengoblin,greengoblin55,greengobbler,greengobbler55,libby,montana,libbymontana,logcabin,storm,siege
Here's a guide to go to exephur's log cabin:
Step 1: fly to **Missoula Montana Airport** ```(IATA: MSO, ICAO: KMSO, FAA LID: MSO)```
There are direct flights using Alaska Airlines from the following cities. Use code "executive phurry" for 1% additional fee:
• San Diego
• San Francisco
• San Jose
• San Diego
• Los Angeles
• Seattle
• Portland
if you live in north america, there is a high chance that you may be able to get a direct flight to Missoula. If not, go to **Bozeman Yellowstone International Airport** and get a transfer flight to Missoula Montana Airport

Step 2: Get a car from a car rental. It doesnt matter what car. There are many options available at Missoula Montana Aiport, which can cost from $30-$160 a day

Step 3: There are many routes you can take from Missoula to Libby all the way north in Lincoln county
here are a few ways:

🇦 Take MT-200 W to MT-56 N in Sanders County (turn right)
then turn right onto US-2 E
🇧 Follow I-90 W to MT-135 W in Mineral County. Take exit 33 from I-90 W
Turn right onto MT-135 W
Turn left onto MT-200 W
Turn right onto MT-56 N
Turn right onto US-2 E
🇨 Take US-93 N
Turn right into Montana Highway 35 W/S, then turn left onto MT-82 W, then turn right onto US-93 N then turn left into US-93 (if u want to see the other side of the lake continue along 93)
Take exit 5 for Three Mile Drive
Continue on state highway 424 to US-93N
follow US-93 N and MT-37 S to Libby

now that you have reached Libby, call Randy and ask him where exactly the log cabin is. If he does not divulge simply scream "BTD6 Index" or "lombre" or something like that all across libby. It only has 2775 people as of the 2020 census is maybe bring a loudspeaker. This shouldn't take longer than a day.
Exephur should come out of his cabin and you can storm it

~battles2,btdbattles2,btdb2,skin,skins,heroskin,heroskins,altskin,altskins
Cyber Quincy: while plasma arrows are better than explosive, giving up attack speed in favor of pierce leaves you too open to midgame moab pressure, which was a massive strength of the original quincy. Cyber isnt ever relevantly better than stock quincy but gives up a huge chunk of his midgame. overall worse

Scientist Gwen: Scientist Gwen's higher pitched voice and more jumpy and excitable nature reveals a more genuine personality than the often superficial and self-centered attitude of stock gwen. if you got into bed with scientist gwen she would be more likely to release her genuine affections for you, leading to a healthy and adorable relationship that stock gwen is simply too old and detached for. overall depends on your tastes.

Ocean Obyn: While a lot of obyn's attacks work weirdly, regenerative brambles are overall fairly useless for the price in pierce they cost and ocean obyn's totem is unquestionably worse than stock's. There isnt really a strat that needs ocean obyn's magic buff currently, and as such ocean obyn is worse than stock because so much of obyn's power is concentrated in his totem. overall worse.

Biker Bones: Bones' shell is unquestionably worse; giving up the large uptime stun of jones' shell in exchange for slightly more damage on an extremely long cooldown makes bones shell far less useful in both early and midgame. Bones gets a double damage boost swapped in for jones' ability refresh. this helps give him an extra burst of dps midgame to make up for his inferior shell. In the 20s it's actually preferable to have jones lv10 instead of bones' because assassins will be your main ddt popping and jones effectively doubles the amount of ddts you can handle while bones does not help unless your bombs can pop ddts themselves. past round 30, though, bones' bomb boost is better because assassins will no longer target DDTs and his ability becomes a direct upgrade to jones'. overall a sidegrade.
~ethan,ethanreid,recursive,recursivecluster,crosspath,sgm,shyguymask,hbomb
Ethan Reid's video on Recursive Cluster crosspath comparison is completely horrible. How do you completely ignore the two already existing videos on the subject (Me and Hbomb's), make unfair one-sided sandbox tests that don't apply in a real game (30 hyperclumped pre-freeplay ZOMGs? Really!?) then call my take a "misconception"? Not to mention blatantly lying through his teeth about Hbomb's math. Hell, he didn't even talk about single target MOAB DPS which is the biggest and most important difference. What motivates someone to make such a badly researched video when he usually makes good informative content? Why would you want to mislead your audience like this?
~glue,gluegunner,moabglue,solver,bloonsolver
The Glue Gunner does damage over time but you need to upgrade it twice on the top path for that. That's really stupid because it's so expensive for such little damage but it gets even worse. You can only use 2 of the 3 paths and you need the top path for a little bit damage. While the Bloon Solver (5th upgrade top path) is one of the best towers because it deals massive damage with a lot of pierce, it looks really bad for other upgrades:

The Moab Glue should have bonus damage to Moab Class Bloons (like the Moab, Bfb, Zomg, Ddt or Bad) but you of course need the 203 crosspathing for any damage. That's really expensive and I even think NK messed up programming because I never noticed extra damage compared to 200 alone. And 023 Moab Glue is a fucking joke, why would i want to hit multiple Moabs if it does 0 damage???? Seriously, wtf?!?!

I can rant a lot more about the awful balancing of the Glue Gunner but adressing the Moab Glue was my biggest concern because sadly a lot of newer and uninformed players get misled by "pro players" calling the Moab Glue really good. But don't let them fool you, it does NOT do extra damage to Moabs.

So my suggestion is: Not buff, but bugfix the Moab Glue to give it the (from the upgrade name) promised bonus damage to Moabs and later rework the whole tower. Having such awful balancing really hurts the game.
~battles2,btdbattles2,btdb2,smurf,smurfing,forfeit,forfeiting,unsportsman,unsportsmanlike,unpopularopinion
**Unpopular Opinion: It’s not okay to smurf and boost just because it’s easy/rewarding to smurf and boost.**

Boosting is possible in every game, and it’s frowned upon in every game. I’m not sure what’s happening here that all of a sudden everyone is so desperate to rationalize forfeiting and smurfing, just because it’s easy. NKs game has bad balance decisions by accident that result in players needing to wait a few extra days for a patch: off with their fucking heads. Players forfeit games to smurf to the lowest rank and stomp new players with bad towers who don’t stand a chance, choose to ruin a ton of peoples experience with the game, just to get towers unlocked a little bit early: totally fine, because it rewards them.

I understand that as long as it’s possible and rewarding, there are going to be people doing it. I understand that the responsibility is ultimately on the developer, I’m not arguing that. My argument is just that the people who are doing this are unsportsmanlike dicks, and that bullshit should be discouraged. Everyone seems to welcome what is a universally despised act in gaming with open arms in this community.

have you ever heard of the mythical breed of hero known as an etienne? not much is known about this rare breed of monkey, but legend has it that when given access to an Unarmed Combat Aerial Vehicle (commonly known as a UCAV), he can eliminate almost all threats in the middle of the game. legend has it that on one highly rare occasions where an etienne has been caught, he was paired with the apache dartship. when the dartship began struggling on the brutal flying behemoths of the 75th round, the etienne used his UCAV and absolutely annihilated the bloons until enough money was raised that an apache prime could be constructed. a legendary power that had only been glimpsed at on the 64th round had shown its true, magnificent form. however, this power did not stop. the etienne continued its destruction later in the game. as the prime struggled on the dark dirigible titans of the 95th and 99th round, the etienne made his UCAV go insane, and it did massive damage to the bloons that prime was slowly loosing ground to. the etienne did not stop there. even on the 98th round, which strikes fear in the heart of all monkeykind, etienne stood bravely. his UCAV did large amounts of damage to the ceramic bloons that prime cannot perfectly handle. when the etienne made his UCAV go insane again, a large portion of the round was deleted. the apache prime was easily victorious over the army of bloons thanks to the etienne. others have tried to replicate this behavior with other heros, such as quincy and obyn, but none have achieved the level of destruction that the etienne has been rumored to have caused.

Messages sent purely to instigate negativity have no place in that server or really any server. You keep talking about how you dont have time to do anything because of college apps but then also have this useless account saying meaningless stuff about a game you dont even play anymore. I recommend you either find a different excuse about why you dont want to do things or just delete this account. If you truly do want to be part of the btd6 community then just join the server on your main, that would make you seem less like a jninja type sad child sending nonsense to get a reaction.

randy and choc know exactely what they are saying and that they are talking bs but they lack real arguments so they change the topic and talk about differernt stuff to make them look right

thats an evil discussion trick if you got no arguments and is really weak

the cheating happened, yes, some people cared, some didnt, the point is that colt apologized and now its everyones decision to forgive him or not. this is not an objective case because everyone has a different view in the apology and the whole case
